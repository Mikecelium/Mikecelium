- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mikecelium
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding optimum health conditions for people based off of non-invasive scans and pattern matching with diet/workout/lifestyle
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything in the 3D machine learning space
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on extracting data from high quality biometric point clouds and images to help understand patterns around fitness, diet and skin conditions
- 📫 How to reach me: Here or my email michael.olsen@akumyn.com.au


Working with several gyms and product designers to build high quality (yet priced for scalability) products that allow an unprecedented understanding of body musculature, fat distributions and skin conditions over time

If you are interested in research in this area and would like to collaborate feel free to message me
